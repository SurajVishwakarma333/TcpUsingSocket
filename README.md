# Tcp Using Socket
Socket programming is a way for devices to communicate over a network. Two sockets communicate, one on the client-side and one on the server-side. A socket's address consists of an IP and a port. The server application starts to listen to clients over the defined port.

Here i am using Hercules Tool for communication.(Client/Server)
